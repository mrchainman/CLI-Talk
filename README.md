This program allows you to use Next cloud Talk form the Terminal.
At the moment it only fetches the conversations and displays the last 3 messages for each.
I will continue working on it, every help is appreciated

## TODO
- [ ] Smaller Todos found as comments in the code
- [x] Fetch messages
- [x] Send messages
- [ ] Automatically fetch new conversations and messages periodically
- [ ] Wrap everything into a curses menu
- [ ] Write tests
- [ ] Bugfixing and testing
- [ ] Make code more "pythonic"

## Usage
Just run './main.py' in the directory you cloned the code into.
The first time you will need to configure it through the wizard, the everything will be fetched automatically the next time you run it.

Have fun :D
