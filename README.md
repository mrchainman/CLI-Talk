This program allows you to use Next cloud Talk form the Terminal.

At the moment it only has a text interface, Curses is comming :D

I will continue working on it, every help is appreciated.

## TODO
- [ ] Smaller Todos found as comments in the code
- [x] Fetch messages
- [x] Send messages
- [x] Save the participant-token dictionary to a file to speed up program start times
- [x] Create directories for different files to keep things organised
- [ ] Automatically fetch new conversations and messages periodically
- [ ] Wrap everything into a curses menu
- [ ] Write tests
- [ ] Bugfixing and testing
- [ ] Make code more "pythonic"

## Usage
Just run './main.py' from the bin folder.
The first time you will need to configure it through the wizard, then everything will be fetched automatically the next time you run it.

Have fun :D
